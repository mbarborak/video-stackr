Open source multi-platform program for focus stacking many images.

View the [wiki](https://github.com/noah-peeters/ChimpStackr/wiki/Basic-usage) for instructions.

Focus stacking is often a necessity when working with high-magnification pictures...
Chimpstackr implements the laplacian pyramid fusion algorithm (see: [Sources](#sources))

## Gallery
Following image stacks have been taken by [me](https://github.com/noah-peeters). Each image has been stacked using ChimpStackr and post-processed using [darktable](https://www.darktable.org/). Each image stack contains around 150 individual images. Every image in the stack was taken at around 4x magnification on a (slightly) wobbly rig. This should be a good test for both the stacking algorithm, and the alignment algorithm.

The post processing consists of these steps:
* A minor cropping of the edges (to remove 'artifacts' created by alignment algorithm)
* Sharpening
* Contrast, saturation improvements

The alignment/stacking process for ~150 images took about three minutes on my hardware.

## Build from source code
* Clone repository
* Install python requirements:  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
* Run file ``src/run.py`` to start the program
### Local build
Note: you can only build for your current platform. So for example building an AppImage on Windows is not possible natively.
* AppImage: ``appimage-builder``
* Windows/MacOS: ``pyinstaller --icon=packaging/icons/icon_512x512.png -F -w -n ChimpStackr src/run.py``
## Sources
